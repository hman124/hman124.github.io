Response: we all come together to advise the teachers that we should use our old wildcash. It will be justified. We can tell the principal about it and they will most likely agree. - if not, we lose it all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol &nbsp;A112</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the NSAA gets found out by the teachers and the teachers take action by suspending us and stopping wildcash sales. Response is we stay in the shadows. We may lose employees. We have to be very careful. We will resurface the next year. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol A113 </span><span class="c0">- the NSAA server gets hacked and deleted. Response is we will take a very heavy hit. The NSAA will never fully recover. Luckily the archives are stored on the website so we will create a new server and try to recover. We will keep the model on the old server using Harrison&rsquo;s server model backup.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol A121</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the NSAA goes out of business and all employees leave. Response is we will try to hire new employees and create new rules preventing employees from leaving. The NSAA will lose power but we will recover. We will rebuild under protocol A122.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol A122</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the NSAA gets shut down somehow and all members and wildcash is lost and only the co owners are still with the NSAA. Response is we must rebuild the NSAA. To rebuild it we must create a new constitution. Then we must restart project ARP to hire new members. Then we must increase scavenging and sales. We will offer higher ranks for new members who join fast. We will spread website links around the school so new members can join. We will charge higher prices for items to rebuild our wildcash.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B111 </span><span class="c0">- a new company is formed and outcompetes the NSAA. Response is we will try to hire them or merge with them. If they don&rsquo;t let us, we will increase sales production by buying more gum and hiring more humans.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B112</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- a co owner unexpectedly leaves when there are two co owners. Response is to try to hire a new co owner, a general will be given the rank in a discussion. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B113</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the NSAA has secretly been invaded by enterprise incorporated spies and they attack the NSAA by doing horrible sales and firing people if they are higher ranks. Response is the remaining co owners and generals leave the falling company and create a new wildcash sales group. It will be bad for the popularity of the NSAA but we will model the new group on the NSAA and rebuild using protocol A122. We can not fire all of the spies from the NSAA. The damage will be done and the NSAA&rsquo;s popularity will be ruined. We will create a new company under the same constitution and rules of the original company.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B114</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- A fallen company resurfaces. Response is we merge with the company, if they reject the merge we increase wildcash production and restart project ARP.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B115</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- An angry member edits an editable archive document of the NSAA and deletes it. Response is fire the member. The document will be ok because Zane miller backed up most NSAA archive documents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B337 </span><span class="c0">- A member creates another civil war within the company. Response is we will fire the member if it is a member. If it is a group, the company votes for changes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B117</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the NSAA&rsquo;s wildcash gets stolen. Response is the NSAA will put a 50 dollar bounty on the wildcash. If we know who the thief is we will devote all time and energy to getting the wildcash back. That will be the only thing the NSAA will do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol R111</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the NSAA discord server is raided somehow. We will respond to this by banning the raiders as fast as possible and then deleting those any raid messages. Then the NSAA can also counterattack and have revenge. For more serious cases the NSAA will activate protocol A113.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B118</span><span>&nbsp;- enterprise incorporated rejects the unmerge at the beginning of eighth grade. Response is we tell them this is our decision and we </span><span class="c4">will </span><span class="c0">unmerge. If they continue to stay merged with us and reject what we have said we will just use their wildcash and not let them have a say in what we buy. If the situation gets more serious we will pretend to delete the NSAA and work in the shadows for a month to make them think there is no more NSAA.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B119</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the pen from project penlink is stolen. Response is we will put a 200 wildcash bounty on it. We will track it down using everything we have. While we are looking We will use the backup penlink pen that came with it because there are two penlink pens. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c6">Protocol B121</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;code name: retribution - the NSAA is slightly split up when we go to high school. We will create a new rank called field commander. It will have powers over members but it will not be stronger than general. The field commanders are the NSAA members that went to different high schools. All field commanders are required to join the discord server. The field commanders have authority to hire new members from their high school and start a new branch of the NSAA. If a general is sent to another school that will not need to be given the field commander rank because they already have the power to start an NSAA branch. Whoever starts a new branch in a different school is the leader of that branch. A co owner, a general or a field commander. If multiple members go to the same high school there will be a vote of who becomes the field commander. The other members will be part of the new branch.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B122</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- a co-owner is sent to another high school by the end of 8th grade. Response is he school that as the most co owners will be the main branch of the NSAA. The other co-owner will be in charge of another branch of the NSAA from their school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B123</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- all the co-owners are sent to other high schools. Response is we will have to heavily branch off the NSAA. If there is a higher number of generals or members with one of the co owners they will have the main branch. If there isn&rsquo;t a higher number of generals of members with one of the co owners the NSAA will not have a main branch and be fully branched off to different schools.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B124</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the members that are field commanders reject their duties and don&rsquo;t start new branches of the NSAA. Response is they will be fired and the main branch of the NSAA ( if there is one ) we will hire new members by restarting project ARP.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B125</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- everyone who goes to a different high school than the main branch of the NSAA doesn&rsquo;t start new branches and leave. Response is the main branch will restart project ARP and increase wildcash production. The NSAA will recover slowly but the main branch will become as big as the NSAA once was.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B126</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- a co-owner is sent to another high school &nbsp;and doesn&rsquo;t start a new branch. Response is to immediately fire that co-owner without a vote. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B127</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- two co owners go to different high schools and don&rsquo;t restart the NSAA leaving only one co owner left. Response is the NSAA will basically restart If there are some surviving members or generals with the co owner one of them ( a general before a member ) will be promoted to co owner. If there is no one left and the only NSAA member is a co-owner at a different high school the NSAA will end. The last co owner can start a new company based on whatever they want. They cannot try to continue the NSAA. If there is only one co owner left and all members, generals and co owners have abandoned the NSAA the last co owner has complete authority to do whatever they want. The NSAA will be ended because there is no one left to be promoted to another co owner. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B128</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- all co owners abandoned the NSAA when we go to high school but there are still some members left. Response is two generals will be promoted to co owner under their own authority and authority of this protocol. If there is one general they will be promoted and can choose a member to be a co owner. If there are only members left they can vote for the next co owners under their authority and authority of this protocol B128. ( no voting for themselves ). They will restart the NSAA by making the rank field commander and following protocol B121. If there is no one left at other schools the last members which are now the co owners will restart the NSAA under protocol A121 and A122.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B131</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- a member, general or co owner tells someone outside the company information about the NSAA. Response is fire that member, general or co-owner without voting. That can not be tolerated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B129</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- a branch of the NSAA breaks off from the company and becomes its own company. Response is all loyal NSAA members part of that branch will leave that company. Only the leader of that branch can break off. The loyal NSAA members will leave the new company and if the company will vote on which one of them should become the new field commander for a new branch of the NSAA in that school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B132</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- a general, member or co owner breaks off from the main NSAA in the same school as the main branch of the NSAA. Response is We will fire whoever followed them and devote all funding and resources to stopping them. If we run them out of business they will most likely come back. However the member who was in charge of the break off will not be accepted back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B141</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- the NSAA wants to dump all of the wildcash off of the balcony. Response is we can not do it ourselves because we will get in trouble. We will hire a third party person and pay them 25% of the NSAA&rsquo;s wildcash under the condition that they do not snitch. They will dump the wildcash.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Protocol B152</span><span>&nbsp;- the NSAA loses the speciality cash. If this does happen the current holder of all specialty cash will be questioned and if he lost it for a dumb reason he will be either fired, suspended, or demoted. If the person does lose the speciality cash they also will not be able to handle them anymore. Response will be to try and find the Wildcash museum where is it located and search lost and found. If we do find it and there is </span><span class="c4">NO </span><span class="c0">specialty cash we will have to try to start over the collection and use our duplicates of them. The worse case scenario is if the entire Museum and specialty cash are lost. Then we will get a backup photo album which is currently in the hands of Rahat Hasan and then try to recollect the specialty cash.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
